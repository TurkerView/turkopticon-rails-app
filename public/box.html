<p>Update December 28, 2018</p>

<p>Dear Turkopticon users,</p>

<p>As we have approached the announced "read only mode" date, we've seen vigorous discussion about potential options for making Turkopticon sustainable in the long term. Some of these ideas are promising. To allow to explore these options, we are postponing the previously announced switch to "read only mode."</p>

<p><strong>Turkopticon will continue accepting new reviews in January 2019.</strong></p>

<p>We have no fixed date for a switch to read only mode yet, as we will be working with you all over the next six months to explore options that can keep Turkopticon open over the long term.</p>

<p>More information <a href="https://turkopticon.net/forum/show_post/1772" target="_blank">on the forum</a>.</p>

<p>We've posted a proposed policy for use of the Turkopticon review database for feedback in <a href="https://turkopticon.net/forum/show_post/1759" target="_blank">the forum</a>.</p></s>

<p>Dear Turkopticon users,</p>

<p>We are planning to stop accepting new reviews on January 1, 2019.</p>

<p>Turkopticon has been an all-volunteer operation for almost ten years - but this model has reached its limit.</p>

<p>We are grateful beyond words to everyone in the community who has helped Turkopticon survive this long - especially and above all the volunteer moderators, who have worked tirelessly for years to keep Turkopticon reviews and discussion relevant and useful; and <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/users/12709-feihtality" target="_blank">feihtality</a>, who volunteered hundreds of hours programming TO2 in an effort to address some of the problems with TO1.</p>

<p>We're happy with what we managed to achieve together, but it's time for Turkopticon to give way to the next generation of tools. As far as
we can tell, <a href="https://turkerview.com/" target="_blank">TurkerView</a> does everything Turkopticon does - and it looks like their community has solved a lot of the problems we
didn't manage to. If you don't know them already, you may also want to visit worker-run forums such as <a href="http://turkernation.com/" target="_blank">TurkerNation</a>, <a href="https://www.mturkcrowd.com/" target="_blank">MTurk Crowd</a>, and <a href="https://turkerhub.com/" target="_blank">TurkerHub</a>.</p>

<p>We plan to keep both the Turkopticon 1 and Turkopticon 2 websites up until at least January 1, 2020. All reviews will be accessible through
the websites in their current form. Anonymized TO1 reviews will also be available via an <a href="https://turkopticon.net/apidoc.txt" target="_blank">API</a> and as a file download. If you have questions, feel free to get in touch directly or to post to the <a href="https://turkopticon.net/forum" target="_blank">TO forum</a>.</p>

<p>We're also available to take part in other projects - suggested by workers - to support the community. But we think it's good that workers, not us, will be fully in charge of decisions about tools and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Turkopticon has been a big part of our lives for the last ten years. Thank you all for everything.</p>

<p>Hello dear Turkopticon users!</p>

<p>Please note that Turkopticon will be <strong>down</strong> for about 10 minutes between 3:30 AM and 3:40 AM Pacific Daylight Time on Friday June 15, 2018 for a system upgrade.</p>

<p>We will be doubling the amount of memory on the computer that runs this website. Hopefully that should speed the site up and get rid some of the connection errors people have been having!</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience!</p>
