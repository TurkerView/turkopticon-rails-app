%strong Change username of a reviewer

%p
  Note: The Turkopticon "person ID" or "user ID" is the number at the end of the URL when you click on their username; for example:

%blockquote https://turkopticon.net/by/1234567

%p
  In the URL above, 1234567 is the "Turkopticon person ID" or "user ID". It is completely separate and independent from the MTurk worker or requester ID.
