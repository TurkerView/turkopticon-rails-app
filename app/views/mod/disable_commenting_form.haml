%strong Disable commenting for user ID

%p
  Note: The Turkopticon "person ID" or "user ID" is the number at the end of the URL when you click on their username; for example:

%blockquote https://turkopticon.ucsd.edu/by/1234567

%p
  In the URL above, 1234567 is the "Turkopticon person ID" or "user ID". It is completely separate and independent from the MTurk worker or requester ID.

= form_tag(:action => "do_disable_commenting") do
  .label Turkopticon person/user ID
  = text_field :person, :id, :value => ""
  %p
    Please double check that the ID is correct before clicking the button below.
