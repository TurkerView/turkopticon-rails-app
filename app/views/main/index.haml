    After even more discussion, comments have been enabled for some people. If you had posted more than 100 comments or 100 reviews, you should have commenting enabled. If you don't, and would like to have commenting enabled, please post in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/turkopticon-discuss/3eZeFBqwJ7w">this thread on turkopticon-discuss</a>. Please be advised that commenting abilities can easily be revoked once enabled, and will be revoked for violations of our <a href="http://turkopticon.ucsd.edu/main/rules">civility guidelines</a>. Thank you!

    We are working on a design for a more robust reputation system that will allow us to have commenting on for everyone by default and quickly hide inappropriate comments, but this is our partial solution for now.
