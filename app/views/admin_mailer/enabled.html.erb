Hi there,

At your request, commenting has been enabled on your Turkopticon account.

Please follow the Turkopticon rules. The most important are:

- Don't make more than one account per person
- Don't include or link to profanity or ethnic slurs
- Don't insult workers or requesters
- Don't threaten people or urge violence on them
- Don't include personal information about requesters (business information is okay)
- Don't include screening information, information about attention checks, or completion codes
- Don't review or comment in ALL CAPS
- If you are a requester, say so clearly in each comment

The rest can be found at http://turkopticon.ucsd.edu/rules.

Commenters who break the rules may have commenting disabled.

Some of the rules are unavoidably subjective. Please use your judgment, or ask if you are unsure about something.

Thank you!

Best,

team turkopticon.
