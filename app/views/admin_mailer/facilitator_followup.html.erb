Dear <%= @email %>,

Hi! Thank you for filling out the form saying you'd be willing to help us hire an organizer to facilitate conversations in the Turkopticon community about the future of TO.

We want to update you on the process. We read your responses and are planning a workshop for you and other volunteers to explain our needs and develop the job call. We'll follow up soon with next steps. We're planning an online meeting that accounts for the needs and concerns that everyone raised in their responses. We think that will take us about two weeks. Please expect another email from us - we'll send it to you at this address.

Thanks again!

Lilly and Six
