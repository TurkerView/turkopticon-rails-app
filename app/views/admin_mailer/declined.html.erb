Hi there,

You're getting this email because you asked for commenting on Turkopticon but your account is very new, with zero or very few reviews.

We're not enabling comments on very new accounts for now. We disabled commenting by default to keep commenting civil. To enable commenting, we need to have some indication you will be civil. The best indication is a history of civil and informative reviews.

You do not need to have commenting enabled to post reviews. You can post reviews by clicking the link to "report your experience with this requester" in the drop-down box added to the MTurk interface by the Turkopticon extension/user script (screenshot and download links are on our home page, http://turkopticon.ucsd.edu), or by visiting http://turkopticon.ucsd.edu/report.

Please feel free to reply to turkopticon@differenceengines.com if you have any questions, or if you think you may have a special case. Otherwise, please feel free to request commenting again once you have posted some more reviews.

Thank you for your patience and understanding while we work to improve Turkopticon.

Best,



team turkopticon.
