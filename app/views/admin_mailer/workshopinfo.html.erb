Dear <%= @email %>,

Hello!

We wanted to reach out with an update on our progress planning our organizing workshop. We're working with a team of experienced workshop facilitators to plan the workshop you've volunteered to participate in. Our goal for the workshop will be to work out what kind of organizing support the Turkopticon community needs, to draft those job descriptions, and to kick off recruiting those  organizer-facilitators. We also hope to build community and trust amongst all of you who have volunteered to steer Turkopticon into the future. 

We're planning two workshops and we'll send out sign-ups in the coming week. 

- A pilot workshop for 12-15 volunteers. These workers will give feedback to help us work out the kinks. 

- The big workshop for all of you, unless you opt to participate in the pilot. 

Again, we will offer a $15 an hour stipend to compensate you for the time you spend participating in this process. 



Thanks!

Team Turkopticon
